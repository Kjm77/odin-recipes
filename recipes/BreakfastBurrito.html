    <h3>The perfect breakfast burrito!</h3>
    <p>Filled to the brim with crispy bacon, fluffy scrambled eggs, savory potatoes and melted cheeses. 
        The ideal start to any day, and ready in ten minutes or less. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large flour tortilla</li>
        <li>4-6 strips of bacon</li>
        <li>2-3 eggs</li>
        <li>3-4 potatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of desired cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsps of salt/pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To start, we dice the potatoes into small cubes and lightly fry them on a small pan with a little olive oil, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>After removing potatoes from the pan, we  set them aside and add the strips of bacon to the same pan; fry bacon until desired level of crispiness then remove, roughly chop and set aside.</li>
        <li>Next up, we prepare the egg mixture in a bowl with a little salt, pepper and butter. After mixing thoroughly, we add this mixture to a large pan over medium heat and mix slowly. </li>
        <li>At this point, we use the smaller pan to lightly toast the flour tortilla while the eggs finish cooking.</li>
        <li>Once the scrambled eggs are at their fluffiest, we begin assembling the burrito. Place the warm tortilla on a plate, then add the ingredients: scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon and then our cheeses on top.</li>
        <li>To roll the burrito, we pinch both sides inward then starting from one end we roll slowly and as tighly as possible. If desired burrito can also be toasted lightly on a pan. </li>
    </ol>
